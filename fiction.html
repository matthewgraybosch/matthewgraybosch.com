<p>This is the speculative fiction I've written over the years. I choose to publish it online under a Creative Commons license because I have a day job and need not seek publication to make a living.</p>
<p>You can bookmark this page and periodically visit to find new work. There's also an <a href="/fiction/feed.xml">Atom feed</a> for use with your favorite feed reader.</p>

<p>I wrote each of these for myself, and publish them on this website at my own expense in the hope that others may enjoy them. As such, the usual policy applies: <em>kudos to contact@matthewgraybosch.com, flames to /dev/null</em>.</p>
