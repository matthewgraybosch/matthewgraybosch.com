title: Is it an Authority Gap or the SNAFU Principle?
description: Men in power don't to listen to women or to most men. This isn't new, and I'm not convinced this is a feminist issue.

Continued from my [commonplace book][1]...

Apparently it's problematic that [men tend not to read literary fiction by women][2]. The linked article doesn't attempt to answer the question its title poses; it's a promotional puff piece by the author of a book that attempts to explore a tangentially related subject: the apparent inability of men to take women seriously even if they hold positions of power or have worked to make themselves authorities in a particular field of endeavor.

I've got a few questions of my own:

* How many men read literary fiction in the first place?
* How many men read for pleasure *at all*?
* What impact does bullying have on male reading habits?

I suspect that Mary Ann Sieghart doesn't bother touching these questions in her book [*The Authority Gap: Why women are still taken less seriously than men, and what we can do about it*][7] because she isn't actually concerned with why men don't read women; she wants to know why men don't accept women in authority over them.

Also, I love the blurb:

- Imagine living in a world in which you were routinely patronised by women.
- Imagine having your views ignored or your expertise frequently challenged by them.
- Imagine people always addressing the woman you are with before you.

Since I'm not a man for whom dominance comes easily this has been my reality more often than I'd like. I can easily accept that people in authority generally don't listen to women, but I have had women in authority over me at work and I know *from experience* that they don't listen to most men, either. This isn't just an issue with men not listening; women in power seem equally reluctant to listen to anybody "beneath them".

I think this raises an important question: Are people in power really sexist, or are they just *assholes*?

I'm not convinced the "authority gap" that concerns Ms. Sieghart is necessarily a *feminist* issue, but I don't generally view the world through a *feminist* grid. If you're used to looking at the world through a feminist lens I suppose it isn't hard to see sexism in every social interaction that doesn't work out in your favor. Since I tend to use an anarchist viewpoint I tend to see tyranny where a feminist would see sexism.

Which of us is right? Maybe we're both right, but neither of us has gotten our hands on [the whole elephant][10].

I think that the refusal of authorities to listen to anybody beneath them is a problem with the tendency toward dominance hierarchies we carry with us because we're [great apes][3]. Incidentally, it's an extremely bad idea to assume that human dominance hierarchies work the same as they do in other primate species, let alone [in wolves][4]. Nevertheless, we need to ask why people with power tend not to listen to people without itâ€”and why *any of us* should listen to those "in power" at all.

- Why listen to the Pope? 
- Why listen to the President?
- Why listen to Mary Ann Sieghart?
- Hell, why listen to *me*?

Every one of us is a conscript in the Hobbesian [war of all against all][5]. Civilization didn't end this war; it merely changed the [rules of engagement][6]. If you trust in authority figures instead of thinking for yourself, you're one of the losers.

Remember the SNAFU Principle, a fundamental tenet of [Discordianism][8]:

> [True communication is possible only between equals][9], because inferiors are more consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant lies than for telling the truth.

The only thing most people in power want to hear is a pleasant lie validating their continued existence as an authority figure. This is the case regardless of sex and gender. So, for now, Hail Eris and have yourself a nice cold beer and a hot dog.
