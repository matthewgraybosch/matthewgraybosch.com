title: Advertising Will Never Be Great
description: You will never succeed in persuading me that advertising isn't terrible, let alone that it can be great.
---

Not sure where I found [this sad excuse for a newsletter][1] by [tZero19e][5], but since the author doesn't allow direct replies by email I'm gonna have my say here.

First, this guy says the following:

> The [cached thought][2] that ads are bad.

First, what even *is* a "cached thought"? Apparently this is a term created by some guy named [Eliezer Yudkowsky][3] who's apparently an AI researcher and a blogger. The blogger part I'll grant, but I'm not sold on the AI researcher bit. [Hans Moravec][4] is my idea of an AI researcher. I think Yudkowski is just some dilettante who wrote an overhyped Harry Potter fanfic and founded a website for wannabe Vulcans who want to be "logical" but don't want to be mistaken for Trekkies.

But let's at least pretend to take this guy seriously for a minute. What is a "cached thought"? Apparently it isn't just a fixed idea or a meme. It's a fixed idea or a meme that you didn't think of yourself. That sounds like *culture*, but I guess that's not good enough for Yudkowsky since he wants to tell people that they should think critically about ideas that came from the culture instead of just thinking a certain way because others think that way.

Whatever. Apparently people believe that advertising is terrible because other people do, rather than reaching this conclusion based on their own lived experience.

According to tZero19e, people dislike advertising for the following reasons:

> - They may hinder ideal UI/UX
> - Often bear a weak relevance

Let's try unpacking these. 

First off, what does it mean to "hinder ideal UI/UX"? I have a hypothesis. Imagine a web page that's supposed to contain an article but instead contains a video ad after every paragraph—with every paragraph containing one or two sentences at most. Hell, you need not *imagine* such a web page; visit your favorite news site on your smartphone and you'll see it happening in real time.

Who's idea of good design is that?

Oh, and what's this about "weak relevance"? Is this guy trying to imply that advertisements can have a "strong relevance"? If so, I'd like to put something out there for all you marketing and advertising people. Maybe you aren't the best judges of whether your work is relevant to others.

Actually, that's kinda mealy-mouthed. So let's go with this instead: **I am the sole judge of which advertisements are relevant to me, and *I* say that in the forty-plus years I've spent doing hard time on planet Earth I have *never* seen an ad I found relevant**.

- Those crappy cartoons I watched on Saturday mornings in the 1980s—not realizing they were just infomercials for crappy toys—because the alternative was *The 700 Club*? Not relevant.
- Punch the monkey? Not relevant.
- That ad for a social media app that only runs on a phone I don't have? Not relevant.
- That ad for "Game of War"? Not relevant—and the Kate Upton cosplay was just pathetic.
- That ad for shoes when I just ordered a pair of boots online? Not relevant.
- That not-actually-handwritten letter by some guy who buys houses no questions asked? Not relevant.
- That email inviting me to join some shitty social network because some idiot who has my email address joined that shitty social network? Not relevant.
- Those billboards I see while driving? Not relevant.
- That recommendation for a 600 minute rant by some white dude the Nazis would have gassed on general principle next to a heavy metal concert video? *So* not relevant.

I could go on all day, and so could just about anybody who has been paying attention the last fifty years or so. Techies keep trying to turn the world into a panopticon just so they can help their bosses sell people stuff they don't actually need—and might not even want in the first place—and they *still* can't come up with ads I'd have to admit were relevant to my immediate situation.

It gets worse, though. Check *this* out.

> Ads are tools that aid problem-solving by matching people to tools that solve their problems. People are notoriously bad at solving their own problems, or even realizing they have solvable problems.

![LOL WUT meme](/assets/images/lolwut.jpg)

Sorry about the image macro, but is this guy for real? We *know* what advertising is about: the creation and manipulation of desire. This is documented fact, we have people on record saying things like *this*:

> We must shift America from a needs to a desires culture... People must be trained to desire, to want new things even before the old have been entirely consumed.
>
> <cite>Paul Mazur, <em>Harvard Business Review</em> (1927)</cite>

The only problems that public relations (a close cousin to advertising, marketing, *and* propaganda) pioneer [Edward Bernays][6] cared about solving was the problem of "insufficient" demand for his bosses' products. I am confident that if you put enough time into digging through his public statements, you'd probably find that he had admitted as much.

But what's this about people not realizing they have problems, or that their problems can be solved (if they buy the right product)? Let's see:

- I had no idea I actually needed Transformers action figures. (Weren't handmade rag dolls enough?)
- I had no idea I actually needed to drink Nuka-Cola. (Wasn't water or cold-brewed tea enough?)
- I had no idea that I needed Axe Body Spray to have a threesome. (Why do I need two women when I only have one penis?)

Neverthless, **tZero19e** thinks advertising is a net positive to consumers because...

> * they get a product for free
> * have an opportunity to passively discover solutions to their problems

![LOL WUT meme](/assets/images/lolwut.jpg)

Again, is this guy for real? What does advertising let people have for free?

- broadcast television, which FCC chair Newton Minow characterized in 1961 as a [vast wasteland][7]
- social media, *another* vast wasteland
- internet "news", an endless expanse of propaganda and punditry designed not to inform, but to provoke outrage and manufacture consent

There might be more, but this is just off the top of my head and adding additional and similar examples most likely serves no purpose but to belabor my point.

But let's talk about what else you get for free in exchange for tolerating the continued existence of advertising:

- censorship
- surveillance
- manipulation

If the government put you in jail for criticizing a law or policy, people would trot out the First Amendment and demand your release from prison. But if you get kicked off of YouTube for doing the same, all you'd hear is crickets. It's censorship either way, but we tolerate from corporations the sort of tyrannies for which people used to overthrow states.

The government doesn't have to spy on you; they need only ask corporations to hand over the data they collected as a result of you using their services. Again, we tolerate from corporations abuses we'd never permit from our leaders in the absence of manufactured consent.

Those problems for which advertising supposedly allows you to passively discover solutions are often imaginary and wouldn't exist at all without advertising.

A well-designed ad is one that creates desires where none previously existed while promising that the product the ad seeks to sell will provide the solution. A well-designed ad does not serve anybody but the advertiser and their clients. 

Making "better ads" will not change this. The solution is to strip corporations of First Amendment protection and ban all non-factual advertising by corporations. This is not a palatable solution for people who profit from advertising, but I'm not one of them and they're no friends of mine.
