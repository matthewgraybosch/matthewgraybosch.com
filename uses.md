I'm [Matthew Graybosch][1], a onetime musician turned [sf writer][2] and software developer. I prefer to write, but building CRUD applications pays the bills and keeps me in prog metal albums. Here's a breakdown of the gear and software I currently use.

## website

* OpenBSD
* GNU Emacs
* HTML
* CSS
* m4
* make
* some shell scripts
* tidy
* cwebp
* rsync

## @home

Here's what I use when I'm not working to pay the bills. I got [bitten by the Unix bug in college][3], and ended up using GNU/Linux and BSD on my personal gear. A lot of Unix stuff worked its way into my sci-fi writing, too. It was also a way to enforce separation between work and the rest of my life, and having Unix experience came in handy when I shifted from doing desktop apps to web apps at my day job.
