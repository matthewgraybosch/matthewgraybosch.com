I'm a science fantasy author and a full-stack thaumaturge. My novels include *Starbreaker*, *Without Bloodshed*, and *Silent Clarion*. I build web and cloud applications at my day job. I run GNU/Linux and BSD on my personal computers. Heavy metal saved my life.


## My Fiction

I write fiction as an escape from my day job and a way to keep a sense of balance between the techical/analytic/logical and the artistic aspects of my life. It was also less likely to annoy the neighbors than trying to compose rock operas in an apartment. Most of my fiction is part of my Starbreaker saga, a collection of scifi/heavy metal pastiches.

Though I don't share my fiction on this site, here's a brief summary.
