description: Parallelized FLAC to Ogg Vorbis transcoding on GNU/Linux and BSD
---

For some reason I had gotten it into my head to rip my entire CD collection to FLAC (Free Lossless Audio CODEC) so that I could have maximum fidelity digital music. After all, I had disk space out the wazoo and nothing better to do than swap CDs.

However, it's occurred to me that being a middle-aged metalhead I'm just wasting disk space. There might be a quantifiable difference between FLAC and Ogg Vorbis encoded at maximum quality, but it's not one I can hear with a decent set of wired headphones.

There's no sense in ripping everything again, though. Not when it's possible to transcode FLAC to Ogg Vorbis. However, I've got a *lot* of files and I don't want to spend weeks transcoding tracks piecemeal. Thus, I wrote a little script called "flacconv" that uses find and xargs to parallelize the process.

You run this by calling "flacconv 8" (or however many cores your CPU has) and it will do the rest. Why do it this way? Because it's *fast*. It's so fast that [a well-crafted find/xargs sequence can outperform Hadoop for many workloads][1].
